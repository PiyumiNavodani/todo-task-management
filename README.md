## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Java 17+ (only required for manual backend builds)
- Node.js 18+ (only required for manual frontend runs)

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Backend (Spring Boot)

Navigate to the backend folder and run: 
./mvnw.cmd clean package -DskipTests

This command:
- Uses Maven wrapper to run Maven tasks
- Cleans previous builds
- Packages the project into a JAR file
- Skips running tests to speed up the build

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Move to Project Root

If you‚Äôre in the backend folder, go to the root folder where `docker-compose.yml` is . To go to root folder, run command:
cd ..

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Application Using Docker

From the root folder, run:
docker-compose up --build


This command:
- Builds Docker images for backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL
- Starts all services as defined in `docker-compose.yml`

---

## Access the App

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000  
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080/api/tasks  
- PostgreSQL: Running inside Docker at localhost:5432
